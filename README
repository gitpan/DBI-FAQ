BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

    Read this file thoroughly.

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

        perl Makefile.PL

    If Perl5 is NOT installed do:

        perl Makefile.PL PERL_SRC=/path/to/perl/source/dir

    Then do:

        make
        make install

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.
